                <hr/>
                <p>Less than 5% of schools taught mathematics during the Industrial Revolution. Widespread unemployment followed until schools added Mathematics to the curriculum.
                </p>
                <p>Today, in the computer age, less than 1% of schools teach coding in early childhood resulting in a major gap in the requirements of the new world and our children’s skills.
                </p>
                <p>In 2020, AI and Robotics will touch 800 Million jobs. Outclass Academy prepares kids in the age group of 8-14 for this new world</p>

                <hr/>                
                <p><strong>Creation vs Consumption: </strong>Your kids use code to build their own games, animation and apps, fundamentally changing their relationship to technology to being a creator rather than a consumer</p>
                <p><strong>Math performance improvement: </strong>Your kids learn commands, loops, sequences and conditions which strengthen their logic and technical skills resulting in not only an improvement in scores  but also creates the foundation of higher order mathematics 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Transformed abstract thinking</strong>Your kids learn decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking to solve problems logically resulting in significant improvement in abstract thinking scores which is a necessity for scoring top of charts in Math Olympiads and major tests like SAT, JEE, GMAT, CAT etc</p>                           
                <p><strong>Strength and confidence</strong>Being able to code will help kids stand out in their peer group (until coding becomes as common as Math- which is our vision) and become more confident and generate self-belief to persevere and attain positive outcomes

            <p><strong>You can request a trial class by writing to outclassacademy@gmail.com </strong>The first class shall be free for all students after which the parents/kids can decide whether to opt for the paid subscription.</p>
            <p><strong>Coding as a continuous learning activity 
            </strong>We don’t want kids to end the course after creating some basic games and animations but inculcate coding as a life skill which shall give them an edge throughout their lives
          <br/>While the frequency and duration of interaction may diminish over time as students become self-sufficient to learn- our learning platform and instructors shall continue to guide and counsel them to the right direction in their journey of coding (e.g. computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence etc.)
        </p>
            <p><strong>Positioned as a hobby class to create the love for coding in children
            </strong>The first few classes focus disproportionately on puzzles and games with no written notes and homework to prevent kids from looking at coding as an additional subject not even taught at school but rather as a fun activity
          <br/>Over time we introduce more formal learning interventions like study notes, videos, home assignments etc. to accelerate the pace of learning 
        </p>
            <p><strong>Based on principles of adaptive learning 
            </strong>Rather than limiting to a standard, we want students to become conceptually strong and accelerate beyond their grades attaining greater self-confidence
          <br/>The lesson plans shall be tailor made to each students based on the initial few classes which shall continue to iterate based on subsequent learning journey
        </p>
            <p><strong>Use of psychological learning techniques with empirically proven results
            </strong>Our course delivery by the instructor and self-learning content shall be based on scientific learning techniques like retrieval based learning and interleaving

          <p class="lead">Computational thinking is how software engineers solve problems. It combines mathematics, logic and algorithms, and teaches you a new way to think about the world.</p>
          <p class="lead">Computational thinking teaches you how to tackle large problems by breaking them down into a sequence of smaller, more manageable problems. It allows you to tackle complex problems in efficient ways that operate at huge scale. It involves creating models of the real world with a suitable level of abstraction, and focus on the most pertinent aspects. It helps you go from specific solutions to general ones.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">The applications of this approach stretch beyond writing software. Fields as diverse as mechanical engineering, fluid mechanics, physics, biology, archeology and music are applying the computational approach. In business we are beginning to understand that markets often follow rules that can be discerned using computational analysis.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">Computational thinking is a skill that everyone should learn. Even if you never become a professional software engineer, you will benefit from knowing how to think this way. It will help you understand and master technology of all sorts and solve problems in almost any discipline.
